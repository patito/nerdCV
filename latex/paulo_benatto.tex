		    \item \textbf{libpenetra}: The libpenetra was created with the goal of studying the windows binary format 
		                               known as Portable Executable (PE). With libpenetra you can access all information
		                               about PE binaries. (\texttt{https://github.com/patito/libpenetra}) \vspace{1mm}
		                               
		    \item \textbf{libmalelf}: The libmalelf is an evil library that SHOULD be used for good! It was developed
		                              with the intent to assist in the process of infecting binaries and provide a safe 
		                              way to analyze malwares. (\texttt{https://github.com/SecPlus/libmalelf})\vspace{1mm}
		                              
		    \item \textbf{malelf}: Malelf is a tool that uses libmalelf to dissect and infect ELF binaries.
