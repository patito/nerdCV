\section{Summary}       Bachelor in computer science having expertise in software development, good professional   
                        relationship and focused at work. With more than 6 years of professional experience in software development using basically, C language and Linux platform. I am now looking for new challenges and opportunities that allow me to learn new technologies and work with new people. I have interest in software development (C/C++, Python, Java, Lua, ShellScript and Go) and Linux Operating System administration.
                        
                        Open Source developer attending in projects like: libmalelf, malelf and libpenetra. All projects were developed in C language on Linux platform in order to analyze Linux and Windows binaries files.

The first project that I attended was to integrate Asterisk (log calls) and SalesForce. This small project was developed using Python, Flask framework, Html and JS.

I also developed a web application to change user's password (LDAP). This project envolves two parts. The first is responsible to verify and notify (by email) users to change their password each 6 months. The second is a web interface for authentication and changing the password. Again using Python and Flask.

\begin{itemize}
  \item I've created a backup solution using Bareos/Bacula and all solution is deployed using ansible.
  \item Developed a solution in Python/Flask to migrate company emails (Exim) to GMail.
  \item Sometimes I work with Nagios, supporting and developing plugins in python.
\end{itemize}

In my spare time I like to study about programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, C/C++.

        Member of a team responsible to design and develop a system to analyse vehicle traffic on Brazilian highways. 
        Basically my task was read traffic log files with all car's information (speed, length, time) and create a structure
        on memory to store and report human readable information. This project was developed using C language, Debian GNU/Linux OS, GLib and Valgrind (dynamic analyse tool). 
        In parallel I attended of a project to develop a parking meter system, using python language and Raspberry PI. My main task was do inter-process communication using DBus.

    Member of the team responsible to design and develop the roadmap features of a product called
    Guardião used to interecept calls and internet trafic of people whose are being investigated by the police. 
    Specifically allocated on the design and development of a module which main goal is to intercept the actions 
    done on Facebook, WhatsApp and Hotmail of a target, using the gathered data to cross reference with another
    possible targets.

    Main activities: C Development, Scripting, Linux administration, Network Packet Analysis (Wireshark), debugging 
    and testing software, Agile environment.

    Member of a team responsible to design and develop VoIP products. I attend in two big project:

      * In a team we developed a softphone, is a software program for making telephone calls over the Internet using a 
        general purpose computer, rather than using dedicated hardware. The softphone runs in Windows platform and was
        developed using C Language, VisualStudio and sofia-sip library.

      * A VoIP phone that uses Voice over IP technologies for placing and transmitting telephone calls over an IP network. 
        My main task in this project was cross-compiling the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries to develop the touch screen
        interface. 

      Other activities involves: Linux administration, C development, Python and Shell scripting, Network Packet analysis, 
      debugging, profiling, code analysis, /etc.

\section{Open Source Projects}
		\begin{itemize}
		    \vspace{2mm}
		    \item \textbf{libpenetra}: The libpenetra was created with the goal of studying the windows binary format 
		                               known as Portable Executable (PE). With libpenetra you can access all information
		                               about PE binaries. (\texttt{https://github.com/patito/libpenetra}) \vspace{1mm}
		                               
		    \item \textbf{libmalelf}: The libmalelf is an evil library that SHOULD be used for good! It was developed
		                              with the intent to assist in the process of infecting binaries and provide a safe 
		                              way to analyze malwares. (\texttt{https://github.com/SecPlus/libmalelf})\vspace{1mm}
		                              
		    \item \textbf{malelf}: Malelf is a tool that uses libmalelf to dissect and infect ELF binaries. 
		                           (\texttt{https://github.com/SecPlus/malelf})
